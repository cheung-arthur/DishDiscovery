# ðŸ¥˜Dish DiscoveryðŸ¥˜
Since I came into college, I've gotten into cooking as a hobby a lot! A common pain point for me though, is when I'm not sure what to cook for a meal with the ingredients I have.

So, I decided to use my knowledge of ReactJS and API fetching using Axios to create an app that outputs possible recipes for dishes given the input of a specific ingredient!

I used the Edamam API for this project, which houses an extensive database of more than 2.3 million food items. You can perform searches for any dish you desire, and the API will provide a diverse selection of recipes for your chosen dish.


Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:

I made this app primarily for my own use, and so I haven't hosted it online. Though, feel free to use this for yourself too!


# Usage Instructions 
*Note: You need to have installed node.js and npm beforehand
## Installing dependencies

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
